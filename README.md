# Federated Learning With Opacus (PyTorch)

In this repository, I used PyTorch and Opacus to simulate the fedavg algorithm of federated learning. And add differential privacy in the models.


# Requirments

* Python3
* Pytorch
* Torchvision
* Opacus


# Running the experiments
```
python main.py
```

# Further Readings
What's more, the experiment of this paper will be reproduced in the future “Projected Federated Averaging with Heterogeneous Differential Privacy” (accepted by VLDB 2022).
