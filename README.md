# Federated Learning With Opacus (PyTorch)

In this repository, I used PyTorch and Opacus to simulate the fedavg algorithm of federated learning. And add differential privacy in the models.


# Requirments

* Python3
* Pytorch
* Torchvision
* Opacus


# Running the experiments
```
python main.py
```

# Advantage
Compared to the fedavg done by others, my model is more featured, you can watch my code.
